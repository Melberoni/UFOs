# UFOs
## Purpose
Provide users access to UFO sigting data and the abiltiy to do a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing them to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, a user can filter for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
A user can search through the UFO databse by filtering on different values of the data. See screen shots below for the usage of this webpage.
If someone only wants to list UFO sigtings on a certain date they can enter the date into the date box in the format mm/dd/yyyy
If someone only wants to list UFO sigtings in a certain city they can enter the full name of the city into the city filter box as shown
If someone only wants to list UFO sigtings in a certain state they can enter the two digit state code into the state filter box as shown
If someone only wants to list UFO sigtings in a certain country they can enter in the two digit country code into the country filter box as shown
If someone only wants to list UFO sigtings with a certain shape they can enter the name of the shape into the shape filter box as shown
A person might decide that entering in only one filter brings back too many results so they can enter in multiple filters to continue to drill down into the data the screenshots below are some examples.
for someone to reset the database all they need to do is delete the filters

## Summary
In summary this webpage makes it possible for users to investigtae the UFO data on their own using multiple filters. However one drawback is the way the user has to enter the data. I already made it so that they dont have to enter only lower case values, but it would be nice to be able to use full country names and state names and map them to the country codes. Or instead of the user entering in values for country, state and shape the user could just select from a drop down menu instead. This way the user doesnt have to know what is and is not a value that will work. it would also be nice to accept multiple date formats for those that might be used to dd/mm/yy formats.
